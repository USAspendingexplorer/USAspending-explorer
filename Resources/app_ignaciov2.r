############ Building the Dashboard##################

# The UI consists of a header, a sidebar, and a body.

# The server consists of functions that produce any objects

First, they examine how much of the federal funding going to each county is in the form of project grants (because these awards are assigned through an open competitive process). They use the variable assistance type to hone in on spending from project grants versus spending from other types of grants such as block or formula grants. They assume that counties who have a large amount of their funding coming from project grants are successfully finding and applying for competitive opportunities while counties with low project grant funding may be missing out on potential awards.
